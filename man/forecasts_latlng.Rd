\description{
\code{forecasts_latlng} calls Forecast Weather by Geolocation Endpoint of API using Lat/Lon Constuct
}
\details{
The Weather APIs provide access to aWhere's agriculture-specific Weather Terrain™ system,
and allows retrieval and integration of data across all different time ranges—long term normals,
daily observed, current weather, and forecasts. These APIs are designed for efficiency,
allowing you to customize the responses to return just the attributes you need.

Use this API to return today's forecast plus the forecast for up to 7 more days. Forecasts are available
in many sizes of hourly blocks, from hourly to daily. The data this function returns is
Min/Max Temperature, Precipitation Amount, Chance of Precipitation,
Max Humidity, Relative Humidity, Solar Radiation, Average Wind Speed, Max Windspeed, Percentage
of Sky Covered by Clouds, and Percentage of Clear Sky.  Used the Lat/Lon construct to request data.
Uses default units returned by the API
